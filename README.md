# Cryptography

This cryptography repository is a work in progress...

crypto_numbertheory.py collects the number theoretic (mathematical) functions required for cryptographic algorithms. These include functions that change the base representation of an integer, calculate the gcd...

crypto_aux.py collections functions which are necessary for cryptographic algorithms but not (strictly) of a mathematical nature. Includes functions which turn plaintext into bytes and bits. Also hamming distance of two plaintext strings.
