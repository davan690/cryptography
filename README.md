# Cryptography

This cryptography repository contains my code from studying crypto.

crypto_numbertheory.py collects the number theoretic (mathematical) functions required for cryptographic algorithms. These include functions that change the base representation of an integer, calculate the gcd...

crypto_aux.py collects functions which are necessary for cryptographic algorithms but not (strictly) of a mathematical nature. Includes functions which turn plaintext into bytes and bits. Also hamming distance of two plaintext strings. 

The folder "working" contains all the files I have written (so far) for working out the solutions to the cryptopals problems. Code is not pretty.
